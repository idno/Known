The Known community has created a number of highly useful plugins to enhance your 
Known experience.

If you would like to have your plugin listed here, send a pull request to this page 
containing the name of your plugin, a description, and a location where you can 
download it (e.g. it's github repository).

The Known project has no responsibility for third party plugins, and will not provide support, 
emotional or otherwise, should the plugin cause your computer to eat your cat.
